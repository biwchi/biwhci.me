## Welcome to my portfolio

Hi, I'm Sergey, a web developer specializing in Frontend development. I'm passionate about creating top-notch solutions that are both functional and visually appealing. I am hardworking and not afraid of tackling complex tasks and projects.

I create a variety of web applications, including dashboards, landing sites, and mobile applications, using a modern tech stack. My frontend expertise lies in frameworks like Nuxt, Vue, React, Tailwind CSS, Vite, and Vitest, with some experience in Next.js. On the backend, I have developed applications using Nest.js, Express, and Java Spring Boot.

In addition to coding, I utilize tools like Docker for containerization, Git for version control, and PM2 for process management. I am friendly and love working in a team environment, as I believe collaboration is key to success. Personal growth and development are my main priorities.

You can see some of my projects [here](/projects).
